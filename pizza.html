    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is a pizza recipe passed down through generations. It originated in
      Naples, Italy and has made its way to America. The dough crispy on the
      outside and fluffy on the outside. The cheese and sauce melt perfectly
      together for the ultimate pizza experience.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 16 ounce ball of pizza dough</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>3 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>5 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese, about 1 and 1/4 cups</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons shredded parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          NOTE: The ingredient list has the amount of toppings you need to make
          <strong>one 12-inch pizza</strong>. If you followed my pizza dough
          recipe, you will have 2 balls of dough. If you want to make them both
          right away, be sure to double the topping ingredients shown here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Place a pizza stone in the bottom third of your oven. (place a rimmed
          baking sheet or a pizza pan in the oven if you don't have a stone.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Preheat your oven to 550 degrees F</strong>, or as high as it
          will go (at least 475.) Let the stone preheat for 30 minutes. I don't
          care when your oven beeps to tell you it's at temperature. Set a
          timer, 30 minutes at least!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Prepare a work surface</strong>. I prefer to rub my counter
          with oil, but you can lightly dust it with flour if you have a very
          sticky dough. (Too much flour can turn your dough tough.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Roll out the dough</strong>. Place your ball of pizza dough in
          the center of your prepared work surface and use your hands to press
          it down, starting from the center. Keep gently patting out the dough,
          moving the dough outward from the center. I usually use my hands for
          pizza dough, gently patting and stretching (and yes, picking it up and
          maybe even tossing!), but you can also use a rolling pin. Make sure to
          keep rotating the pin so that you get a roughly circular shape. It
          doesn't have to be perfect! Even if you have used a rolling pin, I
          like to use my fingers afterward to shape the edges into a thicker
          crust. See photos.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper</strong>. I
          highly recommend using parchment paper because it is SO much easier
          transferring your pizza into the oven. You can pick it up carefully
          with your hands and rearrange it on the paper, or wrap it around your
          rolling pin to help transfer. (I've tried rolling the dough out
          directly onto parchment paper. It doesn't work well.) Make sure you
          stretch out the dough so that it is about 12 inches.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Par bake</strong>. Once the oven is up to temperature, we are
          going to do a 1 to 2 minute par bake. This step is technically not
          necessary, but I never skip it. It guarantees not only a thoroughly
          cooked crust, but a nice and crispy one. Nobody wants a doughy pizza,
          yuck. (If you want to skip it, you can proceed with topping your
          pizza).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Top your pizza</strong>. Leave the crust on the peel while you
          add your toppings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add 1 cup of pizza sauce (I like to spread it around with a ladle).
        </p>
        <p>
          Add 3 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella, and then top with 5 ounces of
          shredded mozzarella. I like a lot of cheese and this is about the max
          amount you can add without weighing down your pizza so much that it
          doesn't cook all the way through. This isn't the Bible, you can
          eyeball the amounts on cheese, just keep in mind there is a limit if
          you want a properly cooked pizza.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Bake the Pizza</strong>. Bake the pizza for about 8-12
          minutes. This is going to depend on how hot your oven is, and how
          thick your pizza is. The edges of the crust should be golden brown,
          and the cheese should be bubbly and also starting to lightly brown. If
          you don't have a pizza stone, use a spatula to lift the edge of your
          pizza to make sure that it is browning all across the center on
          bottom. If the bottom is still white, you are looking at a doughy
          pizza. No thanks. Leave it in longer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Remove your pizza from the oven</strong>. lide it directly onto
        a cooling rack to help keep that bottom crust from getting soggy. Let
        cool a couple minutes, then transfer to a cutting board. Slice into 8
        pieces and devour!
