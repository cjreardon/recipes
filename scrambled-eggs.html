    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Follow these simple steps and recipe on how to make the absolute best
      scrambled eggs, which result in pillow-y, fluffy, creamy, flavorful eggs
      every time!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup half-n-half</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
      <li>black pepper, for serving</li>
      <li>fresh chopped herbs, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>In a medium mixing bowl</strong>, aggressively whisk together
          the eggs, half-n-half, and salt until the mixture is uniform in color
          and texture, and is light and foamy, without any separate streaks of
          yolk or whites.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Melt the butter</strong> in a small nonstick pan over medium
          heat, until the butter coats the whole pan and just starts to foam.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Add the eggs</strong> to the center of the pan and
          immediately reduce the heat to medium-low.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Wait for the edges</strong> to just barely start to set, then
          using a rubber spatula, gently push the eggs from one end of the pan
          to the other. Continue this process, pausing in between swipes to
          allow the uncooked egg to settle on the warm pan and cook, gently
          pushing the liquid to form the curds.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>When the eggs are mostly cooked</strong>, with big pillow-y
          folds, but still look pretty wet, slowly fold the eggs into itself
          just a couple times, bringing them together.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Remove from the heat</strong> when the eggs still shimmer with
          some moisture.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Transfer to serving plates</strong>. Finish with some freshly
          cracked pepper and chopped fresh herbs. Scrambled eggs have never
          tasted so good!
        </p>
